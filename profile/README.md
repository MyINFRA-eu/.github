## About

MyINFRA.eu is part off All In One, this project (branding name) handles all the management tasks for All In One and customers. We love to use open source tools and thats is why we also open source our own tools or additions for toolset's we use. We are a big fans off ansible and have open source most off our ansible roles, so you can also benefit from it or even contribute to it. As described below we use multiple types off licenses, depending off the situation.

Some off the sponsorship money may flow back to other developers or projects that I support myself or find very useful.

The majority of the money will be used to keep my development servers running and to upgrade my hardware when this is needed. Power ain't cheap and hardware doesn't last for an eternity.

## Licenses

**The licenses I stand by**

As a developer myself I know it is hard to contribute to the open source community and make money at the same time. This is why I stand by the following licenses, yes even the Fair-Code one's, because we all have to make a living somehow.

This is why some of my code is released under the Fair-Code licenses, free for individual use (yes even for 1000+ employer companies) but forbidden to sell it to their own clients (unless licensed by me).

But fear not, most of my work is released under the open source umbrella with following licenses like MIT, GPLv3 or Creative Commons.

### Fair-Code

Fair-code is not a software license. It describes a software model where software:
- is generally free to use and can be distributed by anybody
- has its source code openly available
- can be extended by anybody in public and private communities
- is commercially restricted by its authors

### Open Source

Open Source software which source code is published and made available to the public, enabling anyone to copy, modify and redistribute the source code without paying royalties or fees. Most used licenses are BSD, MIT, GPLv3 or derivatives of this license.

- is free to use and can be distributed by anybody
- has its source code openly available
- can be extended by anybody in public and private communities
- is not commercially restricted by its authors
